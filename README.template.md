# Map project generated with QGIS OpenLayers Map Plugin

This interactive web map was generated using the [QGIS OpenLayers Map Plugin](https://github.com/wlatanowicz/qgis-ol-map-plugin).

## Quick Start

### Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173/ in your browser to view your map.

### Production Build
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build
```

Built files will be placed in `dist/` directory. Deploy these files to any static web server.

## Configuration

Your map configuration is located in the `config/` directory:

- **`config/config.ts`** - Main configuration file generated by the QGIS plugin
  - Contains layer definitions, viewport settings, and EPSG codes
  - **Warning**: This file is overwritten when regenerating from QGIS

- **`config/configOverride.ts`** - Your custom configuration overrides
  - Add custom settings here that won't be lost when regenerating
  - Merges with the main config at runtime
  - Use this for custom viewport adjustments, additional layers, or UI tweaks

## Maintenance

### Updating from QGIS
When you regenerate the map from QGIS:
1. Your `config/config.ts` will be updated with new layer data
2. Your `config/configOverride.ts` will be preserved
3. Any custom modifications to the template code will be overwritten

### Tweaking configuration
- Use `config/configOverride.ts` for configuration changes

### Deployment
The built application is a static website that can be deployed to:
- GitHub Pages
- AWS S3 + Cloudfront
- Netlify
- Vercel
- Any web server capable of serving static files

## Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev      # Start development server
npm run build    # Build for production
npm run preview  # Preview production build locally
npm run format   # Format code with Prettier
```
